Vishnu's Objective notes

- circ_func returns a point instead of xPos, yPos (Incorporated, not changed)
- TurnElemâ€™s wallFunc need semicircle breakup (Not Tested)
- Render functions need some clarification 
(From what I understand, only one draw command has to be sent in order for shapes/anything to remain for entire duration. The 
objects disappear from screen when they're made null. Therefore, rendering is not a part of the gameloop but only the in the beginning setup)
- turn_calc faulty in quadrant 3 (Done)
- write setendDir() for TurnElement (Not Tested)
- Confirm the proper treatment of 0 angle in circ functions (I think so)
- Finish and add gridEngine (Not Tested)
- Add the obstruct funcs in Track class (Not Tested)
- funcsolve needs a range as arg while our ranged funcs already have it incorporated  (Solved by added lims as a attr of track elems)
- funcsolve's prevx variable does not work as needed, it gives last x where both f(x) g(x) exist, 
line of sight funcitonality needs last f(x) (priority given to f(x)). Otherwise, can just use as 
is and utilize angledpoint_end since line of sight is the only requirement for prevx (the functions that call funcsolve handle it)
